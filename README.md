## Hello, folks!

My name is Mauro Riva and I am an electronic engineer. I pursued a Ph.D. at a [mechatronics institute](https://imes.uni-hannover.de) in [Hannover, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanover) (my Dr.-Ing. Thesis is still on my desk. It's finished but on pause. Therefore, I am still an Ing.). After I left academia, I founded and joined a [start-up in the field of industrial data processing](https://finealyze.com). I have over ten years of experience in technical fields related to data science, and since 2015, I have been working in solutions for industry 4.0. 

Since I was very young, I have always built small projects to solve problems. Github has been helping me publish them, improve my coding, my documentation, and my explaining/teaching skills, and it has given me the freedom to try new things. More importantly, I have constantly received valuable feedbacks and evaluations from the community.

My main activities on Github involve practical application of machine learning, IoT devices, and other miscellaneous projects that I want to test and try. 

Feel free to comment, improve and fork the repositories and projects. To stay tuned, follow me on Github, subscribe to my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/LeMaRivaTech?sub_confirmation=1) and the [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/gIQk9v).
